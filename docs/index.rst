Introduction
============

CRUD Users is a set of companion action classes for the CRUD plugin. It's goal is
to provide a flexible base for various generic user-related actions.

The core philosophy behind CRUD and CRUD Users is that you only need to deal with
aspects of your applications. This means that you should be able to listen for
events in order to modify how it looks and how it behaves.

When to use CRUD Users
----------------------

* When you want to take care about the rules of your data processing and are okay
  customizing how it looks

* If you prefer tweaking, overriding and configuring instead of doing
  everything from scratch.
